# Code for Wolock et al. 2023 Model
This reposistory contains the code used to produce "Subnational HIV incidence trends in Malawi: large, heterogeneous declines across space" by Wolock et al. The analysis is extremely computationally intensive and built specifically for use on the Imperial College London High Peformance Computing cluster. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reproducible version of the paper at this time. We encourage any interested reader to reach out to Tim Wolock (t.wolock18@imperial.ac.uk) or Jeff Eaton (jeffrey.eaton@imperial.ac.uk) to discuss using this model or replicating the paper.
